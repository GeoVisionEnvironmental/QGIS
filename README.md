# QGIS Distribution for MAPIR Cameras
This repository contains the QGIS distribution for use with MAPIR cameras. The distribution is in a beta stage while we work on getting it placed in the QGIS plugin repository.

Camera supported:
- MAPIR Survey2 (all filter models)
- DJI Inspire X3 with [PEAU 3.97mm NDVI (Red+NIR) lens](http://www.peauproductions.com/products/gp39728) installed
- DJI Phantom 4 & 3 with [PEAU 3.97mm NDVI (Red+NIR) lens](http://www.peauproductions.com/products/gp39728) installed

Functionality for above supported cameras includes:
- Convert Survey2 RAW to TIFF, converts DJI DNG to TIFF
- Calibrate directory of images using [MAPIR Reflectance Target](http://www.mapir.camera/collections/accessories/products/mapir-camera-calibration-ground-target-package) image taken before survey or uses built-in reflectance values if no target image supplied
- Converts TIFF to JPG after calibration if desired

Functionality still in the works:
- Creating index images

### Installation
- Whe hope to have the plugin added to the QGIS plugin repository, but until then, please download the [MAPIR_Processing folder](https://github.com/mapircamera/QGIS/tree/master/Packages) and add it to you .qgis2/python/plugins folder
- In Windows, the .qgis2 folder is in C:\Users\<your user name>
- In MacOS X, plugins folder is located in Application/QGIS.app/contents/Resources/python/plugins. To get there you'll need to right click the QGIS application then click "Show Package Contents"

-- Select the "Pre-Process" tab
-- Select a camera model
-- Select an input folder
-- Select an output folder
-- Press the "Pre-Process Images" button

- To Calibrate images
-- Select the "Calibrate" tab
